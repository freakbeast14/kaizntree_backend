## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

- Python (3.x recommended)
- Django
- React
- Node.js and npm

### Setting Up the Environment

1. **Clone the repository**

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/freakbeast14/Kaizntree.git
    cd Kaizntree
    ```
2. **Set up a virtual environment**

    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    ```
    - Activate the virtual environment:
      - On Windows:
        
          ```
          venv\Scripts\activate
          ```
      - On macOS and Linux:
        
          ```
          source venv/bin/activate
          ```
3. **Install backend dependencies**

      ```
      pip install -r requirements.txt
      ```
4. **Set up environment variables**
   Create a _.env_ file in the root of the Django project and add the following:

      ```
      SECRET_KEY=your_django_secret_key
      DEBUG=True # Set to False in production
      ```
   Make sure to replace _your_django_secret_key_ with your actual Django secret key.
5. **Install frontend dependencies**
   Navigate to the React app directory (assuming it's named frontend):
      ```
      cd kaizntree_frontend
      npm install
      ```

## Running the Application

1. **Start the Django backend server**
   Navigate back to the Django project root directory and run:
      ```
      python manage.py runserver
      ```
2. **Start the React frontend**
   In a new terminal, navigate to the React app directory and start the React development server:
      ```
      npm start
      ```
   This should launch your default web browser and navigate to http://localhost:3000, where you can interact with the application.
